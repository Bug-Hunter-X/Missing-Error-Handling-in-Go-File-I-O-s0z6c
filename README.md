This repository demonstrates a common error in Go programming: neglecting error handling during file I/O operations. The `bug.go` file shows a program that attempts to read from a file without checking for errors.  This causes a panic if the file doesn't exist. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.go`, shows how to properly handle this error using the standard `errors.Is` and `os.IsNotExist` functions. This is crucial for creating robust and reliable Go applications.
